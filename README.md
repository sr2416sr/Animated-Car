# Animated Car CSS and JavaScript

This project is a simple car animation built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a car moving along a track with animated wheels and a dynamic background of trees and sky, creating a visually appealing scene of a moving car.

## Features

- Animated car body with a subtle shaking effect.
- Rotating car wheels synchronized with the movement.
- Continuously moving track background to simulate driving motion.
- Layered background scenery including sky and trees for depth.
- Optional looping sound effect that can be enabled in JavaScript.

## Files

- `index.html`: Main HTML file that sets up the structure and references CSS and JavaScript.
- `style.css`: Contains styles and keyframe animations for the car, wheels, track, and background.
- `script.js`: JavaScript for loading a looping sound effect (`sound.mp3`). The sound playback is currently commented out.
- Image assets:
  - `car_body.png`: Car body image.
  - `car_wheel_left.png` and `car_wheel_right.png`: Images for the left and right car wheels.
  - `background.jpg`: Background sky image.
  - `trees.png`: Trees layer of the background.
  - `track.png`: Track texture used for the moving track effect.
- `sound.mp3`: Optional background sound to enhance the animation.

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser.
2. The car animation will start immediately with moving background, shaking car, and rotating wheels.
3. To enable sound, open `script.js` and uncomment the line `audio.play();`.

## Customization

- Modify the CSS animations in `style.css` to adjust the speed, shaking effects, or other animation properties.
- Replace image assets with your own to create different car models or scenery.
- Extend the JavaScript to add control buttons for sound or animation.
